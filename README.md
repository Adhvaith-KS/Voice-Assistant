# Voice-Asssistant
This is a voice assistant I made in 2020, just after 10th grade. I made some changes and applied for a coding competition in 2021 and submitted this project (first place :) ). Then I modified it a lot more and added profiles and log in options (for more ease in sending emails) with sql in 2022. 

It can do almost everything that Google assistant/SIRI can but also send emails/spam someone with emails for you without even opening gmail, which is not something google assistant can do.
